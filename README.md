# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built an application that allows users to view a poster with a random, encouraging image, title, and quote, generate their own posters, save posters, and view and delete saved posters. This entails that buttons have functionality to switch between views. Users are able to click on posters to store them in the saved posters section, and double-click on saved posters to delete them.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Fork the repository 
2. Copy SSH key on GitHub inside the code dropdown
2. Using the terminal, run git clone [SSH key here]
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. Run command open index.html to launch the application in the web browser

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
